# VSCode-cpp-template

This project is a compete c++ template for Visual Studio Code containing a makefile and the "launch" and "tasks" config files to debug the project.

renaming the executable:
1. Change the variable "EXECUTABLE_NAME" in the makefile to the desired name 
2. Replace "app.exe" in the file .vscode/tasks.jason in line 11 to the desired name. Twice!
